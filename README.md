### Fork from typecrafts omarchy scripts

This is a fork with tweaks and additional scripts to automate my Arch set up. The final goal of this is to intergrate it into a fork of Chris Titus Linux Util to have a nice graphical set up to easily automate any set up or changes to my liking on a linux system.
